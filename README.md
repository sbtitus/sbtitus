- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sbtitus (a.k.a Samuel Berne Titus)
- Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine studying Sociology and Demographic and Social Analysis. I'm interested in many different social science research areas. Right now I'm interested in demography: particularly where young adults decide/are forced to live. Boomerang kids are a really interesting population to study. I'm also interested in global racial stratification and inequality. Currently I use quantitative methods: specifically survival analysis for panel data and multilevel modeling. I'm interested in learning more about social networks analysis and using mixed methods approaches.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please reach out if you are interested in collaborating on a project or are interested in replicating my findings. You can email me at sbtitus@uci.edu
